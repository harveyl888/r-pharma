We're just a couple of days out from the R/Pharma round tables!

With the help of an advisory board spanning Amgen, BeiGene, Genentech, GSK, The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Pfizer, The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium (PCCTC), Roche and Posit PBC the following topics are now on the agenda for our round tables (our attempt at paraphrasing these nuanced topics):

-  Can we stop validating R packages internally, and build a pan-industry process?
-  How can we help the path to interactive regulatory submissions?
-  What's needed to be more confident depending on externally governed packages?
-  Can we combine our learnings on making a case for OS contributions?
-  Where is the potential for impact with LLMs/AA/AI for both drug development, and data scientist efficiency?
-  Where are we as data scientists and SCE developers on multi-modal, multi-disciplinary, drug development?

and probably the topic we are most excited about (especially with Roche and others attending, to discuss its SCE for CT/RWE and PHC) is...

-  What is a modern workflow?  What are the key capabilities of a modern SCE?  What can we learn from each other enabling diversity without compromising our SCE architecture - from legacy codebases/languages and their workflows built around mounted drives and unix permissions, through to multi-modal analyses querying multiple data stores via tokens as secrets, mixing not just open source languages, but different dockerfiles in a single analysis.

70 representatives from 42 companies will come together to tackle these and other questions.
