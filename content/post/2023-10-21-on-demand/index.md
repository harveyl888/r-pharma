We are excited to announce R/Pharma on-demand talks and the Expo.

## On-Demand Content

For R/Pharma 2023 we are trying something new! This year we will be **Premiering** talks on our YouTube channel before and after the standard conference hours. This will give attendees a chance to engage with content beyond the standard conference time of 10AM to 2PM EDT. We hope this great content will provide more options for conference engagement and non-EDT inclusivity. We hope to exlore more with this effort in 2024.

During the **Premier** attendees can post comments and interact through the chat. The videos will also be available after the talks finish.

If you wish to experience these great talks live, the videos will be **Premiered** on our YouTube channel at (<https://www.youtube.com/c/RinPharma>) at the times listed below. Talks are also collected in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMtxz1fUYA5ArPGh9axjLsZR7Rq7csrG8).

## R/Pharma Expo

The R/Pharma Expo is a virtual exhibition hall at the R/Pharma conference.
