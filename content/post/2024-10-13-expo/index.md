### Calling all opensource developers! Come Show off you what you do!

Do you contribute to open source by providing a podcast, YouTube channel or packages?  We're excited to announce that R/Pharma 2024 will feature a virtual expo hall where you can showcase what you do.  
The expo will run continuously throughout R/Pharma giving attendees a chance to wander through virtual booths and interact with other attendees.

If you want to take part then there's a few things we'll need from you:
-  title and description of your package, podcast, etc.
-  a short video (up to 5 minutes), either as an MP4 or YouTube link.
-  a logo (hex image would be ideal!)
-  some images or screen captures (optional).
-  website and social media links (optional).

**We'll do all the virtual booth set-up work for you**  
Just fill in this [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9optXVfzmEt29y0wi3iR11L9DKSC8WVvSqe2urUnPC6ZX_g/viewform?usp=sf_link) and we'll take care of the rest.
